Short intro:

VCDS use:
When LCode is started within VCDS, the Long Coding is automatically inserted from VCDS.
The right information text is also loaded from a LBL or XPL file.
Use [Arrow Down/Up] to search for the item(s) you want to change or check.
Add or remove a marker with left mouse to change the current Coding.
After the first change is made, there is a menu [Back to standard] available,
If you want to go back to original Coding.
After there is made a change in Coding, the current Coding is in Windows buffer.
So when you close LCode, the new Coding is copied in the second line of VCDS.

Press [ESC] to close the program.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LCode standalone use:
Paste Long Coding from VCDS into 1) from the ECU's available [01] [09] [19] [46]
[Arrow Down] to 2) and load the right XPL or LBL file.
[Arrow Down] to 3) to search for the item(s) you want to change.
Make or remove a marker with left mouse to change the Coding.
After there is made a change in the Coding, the current Coding is in Windows Buffer.
So when you close LCode, the new Coding is available to Paste.

Press [ESC] to close the program.

Short Coding use:
For use of Short Coding insert the complete Short Coding, including all preceding zeros,
E.g. 0131313 taken from an Audi A6 (4F) Module [46].
See text explanation in "Balloon help" under VCDS Coding,
Or choose the car you have at Openobd.org, E.g. Audi A6 (4F) Module [46] go to:
http://wiki.ross-tech.com/wiki/index.php/Audi_A6_%284F%29_Comfort_System

http://de.openobd.org/audi/a6_4f.htm#46

Press [ESC] to close the program.

Some tips:
If Multibyte Pull-down is pressed just to observe the possible options,
choose the active option again, then the focus is back on the actual byte.

If you don't want to count what number you want to activate,
of the actual byte in menu 3),
use mouse "hoover", the Byte number is shown in the Statusbar.

The length of Coding is shown at the right buttom.

If you enter a "Short Code" manual (less that 5 byte)
you can press [Copy] and the actual definitions of Short Coding is in Windows Clipboard.

You can force "Short Code" by adding a "+" at the start or end, e.g.: +3993 or 0393969+
You can change a decimal number to hex by addaing a "h" at the end, e.g.: 00065493h
You can change a hex number to decimal by addaing a "d" at the end, e.g.: 0000FFD5d
Then press key "Arrow down" on the keyboard.

Press "Insert" to copy binary data from current long coding to windows buffer.
